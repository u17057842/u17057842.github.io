  <h3 class="w3-center">WHY IS THIS NECESSARY</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>A brief description of our rivers</em></p>
  <p>
    Within South Africa there are few rivers that traverse through urban areas that are not touched by 
    pollutants. After heavy rainfall, there is often litter scattered high onto the river banks and caught in the vegetation. 
    Realistically there is no way that municipalities and organizations can maintain South African rivers, keeping them free 
    of litter and pollutants, without a little help from others. Industries pump pollutants and discard waste materials with 
    little thought to those which may be affected. Pesticides and heavy metals that enter the water systems often increase in 
    concentration as bigger animals eat contaminated foods through processes called bioaccumulation or biomagnification. 
    Rivers on the coasts of Africa are responsible for a large proportion of the plastics within the oceans, a problem that has 
    to be prevented at the source. <a href="#Schmidt"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>1</a><br><br>

  Everyone has their own unique set of priorities of what they dedicate their time to. And the people that usually volunteer time to aid
  in maintaining river systems are often local residents or are conservationally inclined.  Many do not see the value that rivers bring 
  to their lives, or the consequences of neglect that extend far beyond the rivers.

    <div class="w3-col m6 w3-padding-large">
      <p>Southern Africa has a huge variety of rainfall patterns and amounts leading to large changes in the watersheds
        (river systems) across the country. The Eastern coastline of the country receives summer rainfall in usually quite
        copious amounts, whilst the North Western coastline is barren and receives minimal rainfall brought in by cold fronts.
        Within Southern Africa, the majority of rivers shorten in the dry seasons or on occasion<a href="#Day"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>. The quality
        of the water within the rivers also changes from season to season, a factor that is affected by and subsequently affects
        the surrounding communities. Some plants that were introduced to South Africa use more water than our plants, and can 
        reduce the amount of water in the rivers by a substantial amount. Communities that require rivers for drinking and 
        washing, may find that their rivers dry earlier and earlier each year. Educating communities, surrounding river systems,
        that certain plants are bad for both themselves and the rivers and how to remove them, can be hugely beneficial. </p>

  <h3>Maintaining rivers:</h3>
  <p>
  <b>For the economists/ capitalists:</b> <br>
  <ul>Reduces cost of potable water purification and increases reliability of the water source. <a href="#"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></ul>
  <ul>Increased revenue from tourism and recreational activities.<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></ul>
  <ul>Cost of prevention is dwarfed by the cost of remediation.<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></ul>
  <br>
  <b>For the nature lovers:</b>
  <ul>Increases the overall health and reproductive success of the many organisms that rely on river systems.<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></ul>
  <ul>Provides corridors for the movement of animals, preventing some animals from dying out in the area.<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></ul><br>

  <b>For the health conscious:</b><br>
  <ul>Reduces the amount of small plastic particles from rivers which end up in tap water and commercial salt products.<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></ul>
  <ul>Potentially reduces the amount of heavy metals within river systems, which can result in heavy metals in human diets<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></ul>
  <ul>Potentially reduces the amount of pesticides in water sources, which can cause endocrine disruptions.<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></ul>

  <h3 class="w3-center">CROSS-SECTOR COLLABORATION<br><i class="fa fa-plus"></i><br>INTERDISCIPLINARY</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Conservation biology is a mission-oriented crisis discipline: a multidisciplinary science</em></p><br>
  <p><b>An example: </b><br> 
    <ul>The Inkomati-Usuthu Catchment Management Agency (IUCMA)<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> responsible for the management of rivers within the Limpopo province, 
      has seen an increase of R15000 of irregular expenditure from 2015/16-2019/20. This amount could be decreased
       by publicly publishing expenditure per section of the watershed. This concept could be enhanced by the addition of budget predictions
        and visually highlighting areas in financial difficulty. 
    </ul>
    <ul>The IUCMA website to view the current data of water quality and river attributes is difficult to interact with due to regular unresponsiveness
       and terribly slow loading times. This can reduce the interest of the public from utilizing the information, due to the hustle and bustle of 
       the modern lifestyle. </ul>
    <ul>The number of river maintenance exercises to “promote knowledge generation and distribution” has decreased from 50 in 2017/18 to 32 in
      2019/20. Education is fundamental in prevention of pollution and the early detection and removal of species that aren't meant to be there
      (invasive species). A simple visual marker indicating the time and place of an educational event could increase public awareness. More information
       on what we get from our river systems is within the conservation section.
    </ul>
    <ul>Despite the seemingly alarming decrease in river maintenance routines, maintenance of flow rate instruments and number of quarterly reports have
       remained almost constant since 2017/18. The annual expenditure and revenue are approximately equal and amount to R130.4 million in 2019/20. 
       Developing websites can be costly and time consuming, more on that is mentioned in the development section of the blog.
    </ul>

      <p>
        If the concept of a publicly available tool for the management of the river systems was correctly developed and deployed, 
        the accumulation of data would be astonishing; data collection is vital in this technological age. The correct development
        of such an app would allow for multiple users, to verify user submitted data. Therefore a large proportion of the data would
        be accurate and could be used for studies. This could benefit industries, agriculture, health and sanitation and conservation,
        amongst others. Therefore the web application, or the idea behind it, is fundamentally important for sustainable living. 
        Education of the value of water systems for those in an industrial setting to a rural community is massively important in
        managing the source of pollution that enters the water systems. The web application aims to increase the rate of data collection
        pertaining to the state of the rivers, over a much larger scale and the accessibility of this data to the general public. 
        Knowledge of the source of pollution amongst the general public, and the consequences this pollution will have for the large
        range of people involved, may improve the pressure to legally reduce pollutants into the river systems.

<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64" id="development">
  <h3 class="w3-center">DEVELOPMENT PROCESS</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Programming methodology for those interested</em></p>
  <p>The application is rather simple, written in Javascript, CSS and HTML, however the process of development was confusing and tedious. 
    Data released by the Department of Water and Sanitation of the rivers of South Africa, was in a shapefile format. 
    This file would have been far too large for a website to load within a reasonable time period so the shape file was dissolved and 
    simplified using qGIS desktop. This shapefile was then exported using the same software into a geoJSON format for use in a web setting.
    Having no prior experience in GIS software, this took considerable effort to achieve. All of the heavy lifting and complex map 
    programming is done by an application programming interface(API) called Leaflet. This is combined with the base maps, in this 
    project three are incorporated, supplied by Mapbox, an API. The next major hurdle was managing to add the river layer above the 
    base layers, in a manner that was not initially overwhelming. Again, having no experience in programming with Javascript, this became
    a time consuming task. The, slightly alarming, popup box asking for the user's location was added, and the little box in the top 
    right allowing the user to control which base layer is displayed. Then due to an urge to be fancy, a feature was added that changed
    a river segment colour based on the length of it, with a corresponding legend. This added an undesirable amount of clutter to the 
    page and initiated the next nearly impossible challenge: adding a sidebar. The sidebar, in its current state, has limited functionality.
    Further development and addition of server side code would be needed. Github only supports hosting client side (static) websites,
    and deploying the application to something like Microsoft Azure is time consuming and complex. For this concept to be a functional
    product, the storage of data(user information etc.) would require the use of such a service. 
    <br><br>
    There is now a drive for the code which runs an application(source code) to be made publicly available(open-source), 
    this can however mitigate the chance of the commercialization of the product. Code that runs this website and 
    the Rivers web application is all publicly available on Github, allowing for contributors to aid in the development process remotely,
    if the code is accepted by the main author.
